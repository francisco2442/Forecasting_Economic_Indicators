**The question we want to answer:** 

What direction should the Federal Reserve take on monetary policy?

Should they implement contractionary, expansionary, or no change to the current policy? 

# Conclusion 

My group and I decided that the Federal Reserve should not change the current monetary policy and continue to monitor the inflation rate.

# Recommendations
- Continue to monitor the inflation rate.
- If inflation continues to increase then consider implementing a contractionary monetary policy.
