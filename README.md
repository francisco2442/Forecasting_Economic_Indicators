# Metrics
### Gross Domestic Product Estimation Equation
- **GDP = F( IP, EPR, CT, GDP(-1), Trend)**
  - IP = Industrial Production Consumer Goods
  - EPR - Employment-Population Ratio
  - CT - Federal government current tax receipts: Taxes on corporate income
  - GDP(-1) - Gross Domestic Product lagged one period
  - Trend - The overall direction of the market
### Consumer Price Index Estimation Equation
- **CPI = F( ASPNHSUS, CPI, CPIUCEDCA, EIUIQ, EIUIR, EMPHE, INDPRO, IPDGMSPCBO, IPEBE, IPMAT, IPMDGCE, IPMDGF, IPMDGMED, TOTALSL, TOTBUSSMSA)**
  - CPI - Consumer Price Index: measures change over time in the prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services.
  - ASPNHSUS - average sales price to houses sold for the United States, dollars, quarterly, not seasonally adjusted
  - CPIUCEDCA - Consumer price index for all urban consumers: education in US city average
  -  EIUIQ - Monthly export price index:
  -  EIUIR - Monthly import price index:
  -  EMPHE - Employment, hours, and earnings for the current employment
  -  INDPRO - Industrial production total
  -  IPDGMSPCBO - Industrial production: durable goods materials: semiconductors, printed circuit boards, and other
  -  IPEBE - Industrial production equipment: business equipment
  -  IPMAT - Industrial production materials
  -  IPMDGCE - Industrial production: manufacturing: durable goods: computer and electronic product
  -  IPMDGF - Industrial production: manufacturing: furniture and related product 
  -  IPMDGMED - Industrial production: manufacturing: medical equipment and supplies
  -  TOTALSL - total consumer credit owned and securitized, outstanding, billions of dollars
  -  TOTBUSSMSA - total business sales, millions of dollars
### Unemployment Rate Estimation Equation
- **UR = F( Comp, UR(-1), Trend)**
  - UR - Unemployment rate: the number of unemployed people as a percentage of the labor force
  - Comp - Compensation of employees, received: wages and salary disbursements
  - UR(-1) - Unemployment rate lagged one period
  - Trend - The overall direction of the market
