  - IP = Industrial Production Consumer Goods
  - EPR - Employment-Population Ratio
  - CT - Federal government current tax receipts: Taxes on corporate income
  - GDP(-1) - Gross Domestic Product lagged one period
  - Trend - The overall direction of the market
### Consumer Price Index Estimation Equation
- **CPI = F( ASPNHSUS, CPI, CPIUCEDCA, EIUIQ, EIUIR, EMPHE, INDPRO, IPDGMSPCBO, IPEBE, IPMAT, IPMDGCE, IPMDGF, IPMDGMED, TOTALSL, TOTBUSSMSA)**
